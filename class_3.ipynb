    "## Difference between GDV and Clustering Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "The image provided focuses on node features in the context of graphlets, highlighting key metrics like the Graphlet Degree Vector (GDV), Degree, and Clustering Coefficient. Let's break down each concept and understand their differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graphlet Degree Vector (GDV) and Clustering Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphlet Degree Vector (GDV)\n",
    "- **Definition**: GDV is a vector that captures graphlet-based features for nodes. Graphlets are small, connected subgraphs of a larger network.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: It measures the frequency and types of graphlets a node is part of, giving insight into the local topology around the node.\n",
    "- **Calculation**: For a given node, count the number of occurrences of various graphlets (e.g., triangles, squares) it participates in. This count forms a vector.\n",
    "  - Example: \\( GDV(v) = [g_1(v), g_2(v), ..., g_n(v)] \\) where \\( g_i(v) \\) is the count of graphlet \\( i \\) that node \\( v \\) is part of.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degree\n",
    "- **Definition**: Degree counts the number of edges that a node touches.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: It measures how many direct connections a node has.\n",
    "  - Example: If node A has 5 edges connected to it, its degree is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering Coefficient\n",
    "- **Definition**: Clustering Coefficient counts the number of triangles that a node touches.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: It measures how close a node's neighbors are to forming a complete graph (i.e., how interconnected a node's neighbors are).\n",
    "- **Calculation**:\n",
    "  - For a node \\( v \\) with \\( k \\) neighbors, the clustering coefficient \\( C(v) \\) is given by \\( C(v) = \\frac{2E(v)}{k(k-1)} \\), where \\( E(v) \\) is the number of edges between the neighbors of \\( v \\).\n",
    "  - Example: If node B's neighbors form 3 triangles, its clustering coefficient reflects this density of interconnectedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Focus**:\n",
    "   - **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures local density of connections among a node's neighbors.\n",
    "   - **GDV**: Measures the presence and types of subgraph structures (graphlets) a node is part of, capturing more complex local topological information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information Captured**:\n",
    "   - **Clustering Coefficient**: Focuses solely on triangles, providing a single value indicating local clustering.\n",
    "   - **GDV**: Captures a spectrum of subgraph patterns, providing a richer, more detailed representation of local graph structure through a vector of counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complexity**:\n",
    "   - **Clustering Coefficient**: Relatively simple to compute, involving only local neighbor connections.\n",
    "   - **GDV**: More complex to compute, requiring enumeration of various graphlet types around the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **Degree**: Counts the number of direct edges a node has.\n",
    "- **Clustering Coefficient**: Counts how many triangles a node's neighbors form, indicating local density of connections.\n",
    "- **GDV**: Counts the number of various graphlets a node is part of, providing a detailed vector representation of local structural roles."

    "     - **Eigenvector Centrality**: Evaluates the influence of a node based on the influence of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structure-Based Features**:\n",
    "   - **Node Degree**: (Also listed here) Represents the number of direct connections a node has.\n",
    "   - **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together. Specifically, it counts the number of triangles that include the node, indicating local density.\n",
    "   - **Graphlet Count Vector**: Similar to GDV, this captures the frequency and types of graphlets (small subgraphs) that a node is part of. It provides a more detailed view of the node's local topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importance-Based Features**:\n",
    "  - These features are focused on the significance or influence of a node within the entire network.\n",
    "  - Node Degree is a basic measure of connectivity.\n",
    "  - Centrality measures provide a deeper insight into the role of a node, considering paths and influence within the network.\n",
    "\n",
